# Overview

**Atlas UI 3** is a modern chat interface that lets you interact with multiple AI models (OpenAI GPT, Anthropic Claude, and Google Gemini) through a single, unified interface. What makes it unique is its integration with the Model Context Protocol (MCP), which allows AI assistants to connect to external tools and data sources in real-time. Whether you're looking to have conversations enhanced by database queries, file system access, or custom APIs, this application provides a flexible foundation for building AI-powered workflows. The interface updates dynamically as the AI uses tools, with support for custom HTML rendering and real-time streaming responses.

Under the hood, the project employs clean architecture principles with a FastAPI backend communicating via WebSockets to a React 19 frontend. The backend uses protocol-based dependency injection for loose coupling, implements two distinct agent loop strategies (ReAct and Think-Act) for different reasoning patterns, and integrates LiteLLM for unified model access across providers. The system supports RAG capabilities, S3-compatible file storage, group-based authorization for MCP servers, and comprehensive observability through OpenTelemetry. Configuration management follows a layered approach using Pydantic models with YAML/JSON configs, while the frontend leverages Context API for state management without Redux. The project is actively developed and welcomes contributions - whether you're interested in adding new MCP integrations, improving agent reasoning patterns, enhancing the UI, or expanding LLM provider support, pull requests are encouraged and appreciated.
