## Security Measures

### Automated Security Scanning

This repository uses multiple automated security tools:

- **Dependency Scanning**: Safety (Python), npm audit (Node.js), Snyk
- **SAST**: Bandit (Python), Semgrep (multi-language), CodeQL
- **Secrets Detection**: TruffleHog, GitLeaks
- **Container Scanning**: Trivy, Docker Scout
- **Regular Scans**: Daily automated security checks

### Security Best Practices

#### For Contributors

1. **Dependencies**
   - Regularly update dependencies
   - Use `npm audit` and `safety check` before committing
   - Pin dependency versions in production

2. **Code Security**
   - Follow secure coding practices
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Use parameterized queries for database operations
   - Implement proper authentication and authorization

3. **Secrets Management**
   - Never commit secrets, API keys, or passwords
   - Use environment variables for sensitive data
   - Use GitHub Secrets for CI/CD pipelines

4. **Container Security**
   - Use minimal base images
   - Run containers as non-root users
   - Keep container images updated

#### For Deployments

1. **Environment Security**
   - Use HTTPS in production
   - Implement proper firewall rules
   - Regular security updates
   - Monitor for suspicious activities

2. **Data Protection**
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
   - Implement proper backup and recovery procedures
   - Follow data retention policies
